# Balsamiq-wireframe
I created a Balsamiq mockup wireframe for an e-commerce website named "Kachabazar". Balsamiq Mockups is a versatile tool that is already proving to be a game-changer for our field. 

This tool helps to strengthen cross-team communication, enhance test case precision and advocate for top-notch user experiences.

I have also made Test Plan for this e-commerce site.
